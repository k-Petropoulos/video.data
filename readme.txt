 For this analysis a kmeans clustering was used on the given dataset. Prior to the clustering, factor analysis of mixed data was implemented to decrease the noise.
 
 Initially,  the data were examined and modified for the purposes of the analysis, with the corresponding visualisations being produced. Then 14 components from the FAMD analysis were selected, based on the variance of the corresponding subspace (95%). Afterwards, inside a loop, the data were clustered with different number of clusters and the 9 cluster classification was selected. This was done based on the between to total inertia ratio. Also, for every cluster, representative categories were assigned to describe it. As a general comment, it appears that the service's data download is most strongly affected by the content of the video, than from the rest of the parameters; stream_id most closely describes the occuring clusters (6 out of 9).
 
 Based on this analysis it appears that the cdn is the prime method for video streaming. Considering that p2p technology relies on the various user's machine, hence it may be assumed it  can be considered cheaper, a recomendation would be to try to reduce "Vectrice" browser usage, which is entirely based on cdn (see 9th cluster). 
 
  Had I more time, I would like to focus on the proportion of p2p data to cdn data usage in these clusters, and perhaps a prediction model of the data to be downloaded for some new stream_id, given the other parameters.
